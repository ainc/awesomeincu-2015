Learning to code is one thing, but writing code that actually gets used out in the world is where it becomes real. The world has a shortage of software developers, and while knowledge is great, many positions require experience. You may know some HTML and CSS, but have you built websites used by thousands of people each month? How do you get experience like this? Apply for the Team Alpha software development apprenticeship.

If you asked who won the 2012 NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament, the answer would be a team called the Kentucky Wildcats. If you asked who runs Awesome Inc, the answer would be Team Alpha. Launched during Awesome Inc’s first year, the Team Alpha program provides apprenticeship experience in a variety of fields, including software development. Team Alpha members have created and maintain five web properties and a growing list of mobile apps that serve Kentucky’s tech and startup communities.

In addition to receiving an official Awesome Inc t-shirt and as many Double Stuf Oreos as you can handle, Team Alpha members work closely with our founders and directors at Awesome Inc. We have daily interaction in-person and via email/Slack chat, weekly all-team meetings, and monthly “Rainmaker” mentorship meetings. Team Alpha members can work from 10 to 20 hours per week, and apprenticeship periods can last from a semester to over a year, depending on member availability and team needs.


Team Alpha Outcomes:

*   Write code that gets used in production environments
*   Practice software development methodologies (agile, version control, etc)
*   Work alongside professional software developers
*   Find out about job opportunities from local tech startups
