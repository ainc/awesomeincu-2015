## What is a Developer Bootcamp?

Like many cities, Lexington’s technology community is experiencing a shortage of well-qualified software developers. While there are several possible responses to this need, many cities have benefited from intensive training programs called Developer Bootcamps. The general model is a 3-month program, in batches of 10-20 students, with a curriculum for full-stack web development jobs. Programs typically cost students around $10,000, and partner employers pay a hiring fee of 10% of the candidate’s first-year salary. The bootcamp is taught by experienced software developers (10+ years industry experience), with a focus on quickly moving from basic skills to project experience. High job placement rates (close to 100%) are the target for these programs. Successful programs are highly selective of their applicants, typically targeting college graduates in their mid to late 20s and early 30s looking to make a career change.
