          <h2>Membership</h2>
          <p>Learning to code can be intimidating on your own. Maybe you’ve gotten started on Codecademy, but never finished that JavaScript track. Perhaps you’ve dabbled in iPhone app development, following a series of video tutorials, but got stuck somewhere Objective-C and an NSObject. If you’re looking to make a career switch, or just want to learn a valuable new skill, the Awesome Inc U Membership program is made for people like you.
