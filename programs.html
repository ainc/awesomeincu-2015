    <p>Learning to code is difficult, but so is learning salsa dancing or playing the guitar. Consistent practice, week after week, is how you become a great programmer. Our extended-length programs take the basic skills learned in our courses and reinforce that new knowledge with hands-on experience. We have programs for all ages, starting with our After School Coding Club and Academy for Middle and High School students, to Team Alpha for upper-level high schoolers and college students, to the Membership program for college students and Adults.</p>

          <p>So, you’ve got the basics down. You’ve taken a class or two, followed some tutorials, built a few “Hello, world” programs. How do go beyond learning-to-code and take your software development skills to the next level? The Awesome Inc Academy is our answer.

          <p>Learning to code can be intimidating on your own. Maybe you’ve gotten started on Codecademy, but never finished that JavaScript track. Perhaps you’ve dabbled in iPhone app development, following a series of video tutorials, but got stuck somewhere Objective-C and an NSObject. If you’re looking to make a career switch, or just want to learn a valuable new skill, the Awesome Inc U Membership program is made for people like you.

          <p>Do you have a student at home who spends too much time on the computer, plays lots of Minecraft, or enjoyed doing the Hour of Code at school? The After-School Coding Club is the place to take that interest in technology, and turn it into a productive skill. Designed for boys and girls in middle school who want to try out programming, the Coding Club is a fun way to learn to code in a social, after-school setting.

                </a>
          <p>Learning to code is one thing, but writing code that actually gets used in the world is where it becomes real. The world has a shortage of software developers, and while knowledge is great, many positions require experience. You may know some HTML and CSS, but have you built websites used by thousands of people each month? How do you get experience like this? Apply for the Team Alpha software development apprenticeship.
