What happens when you’ve pushed the limits of block-based programming languages like Scratch? It’s time to start using more powerful, professional-grade tools. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the building blocks of the web, and are the focus of our intermediate-level course for youth, the Coding League.

Students in the Coding League use code to create websites. These websites range from informational pages on students’ hobbies and interests, to interactive games, and handy utilities. Coding League participants should have some prior programming experience, such as a basic course at school or [Awesome Inc’s Coding Club](/coding-club/). Since we’ll be using text-based programming languages, students should be comfortable typing at [20 words per minute](https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english) or faster.

The Coding League is designed for students ages 11 - 14 (approx. 6th - 9th grade)
Please inquire if your student doesn't fit that age range but you still want them to participate - info@awesomeincu.com
