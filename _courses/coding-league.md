### **What happens when you’ve pushed the limits of block-based programming languages like Scratch?**

It’s time to start using more powerful, professional-grade tools. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the building blocks of the web, and are the focus of our intermediate-level course for youth, the Coding League. Students use code to create websites. These websites range from informational pages on students’ hobbies and interests, to interactive games, and handy utilities.

Coding League participants should have some prior programming experience, such as a basic course at school or [Awesome Inc’s Coding Club](/coding-club/). Since we’ll be using text-based programming languages, students should be comfortable typing at [20 words per minute](https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english) or faster.

Come back for as many sessions as you’d like, the fun and the knowledge keeps on building. Sign up with friends, or meet new people with similar interests.

## Coding League Outcomes:
- Go beyond to block-based languages to use text-based programming
- Learn Computer Science fundamentals
- Explore the creative power of programming, start building a portfolio of professional-quality code
