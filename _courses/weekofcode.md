Every parent today wants their kids to learn how to interact with technology in a healthy way, make friends, and be prepared for a 21st-century world, including getting into college and finding a job they love and at which they will succeed. Week of Code Summer Camp does all of that.

### Prepare Your Child For a 21st Century World

At Week of Code, you learn by doing - it's hands-on, at your pace. You'll design and develop your very own website, mobile app, and video game in one week. Work with industry-standard hardware and software, complete a final project of your choice, build a portfolio, and bring your new tech knowledge and skills into the real world.

In addition to programming time inside, campers will interact with our upbeat team for unplugged activities and games. More than just coding - Week of Code boosts creativity, logical thinking skills, and brain power. The camp is kept small to ensure everyone gets focused attention.
