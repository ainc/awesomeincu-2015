What if your child spent their summer learning to make apps instead of playing them? This camp for middle and high school students introduces the fundamentals of coding. Students will create websites, hardware projects, and video games all while having fun with our energetic team.

By the end of the week, each student will have built at least one web page, app, and video game using programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#. The camp is kept small to ensure everyone gets focused attention and learns at their own pace.

More than just coding - Week of Code boosts creativity, logical thinking skills and brain power! In addition to programming time inside, campers will interact with our upbeat team for unplugged activities and games. Week of Code is a blend of computer programming, problem-solving, and teamwork!

### Outcomes

- Develop a Mobile App with Android
- Create a Website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
