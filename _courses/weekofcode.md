What if your child spent their summer learning to create video games instead of playing them? This camp, for 10-15-year-olds, introduces the fundamentals of coding while teaching students how to become responsible digital citizens. Campers will learn how to design their own website, app, and video game in one week.

In addition to programming time inside, campers will interact with our upbeat team for unplugged activities and games. More than just coding - Week of Code boosts creativity, logical thinking skills, and brain power. The camp is kept small to ensure everyone gets focused attention and learns at their own pace.
