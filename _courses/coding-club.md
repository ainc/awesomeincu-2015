### **Do you have a student at home who enjoys spending time on the computer, could play Minecraft for hours, or has done the Hour of Code at school?**

The Coding Club is the place to take that interest in technology, and turn it into a productive skill. Designed for boys and girls in elementary and middle school who want to try out programming, the Coding Club is a fun way to learn to code in a social, after-school setting.

### The Coding Club is designed for students ages 9-12
Please inquire if your student doesn't fit that age range but you still want him/her to participate -[info@awesomeincu.com](mailto:info@awesomeincu.com)

The Awesome Inc Coding Club is our program for students who want to learn a basic understanding of computer programming under the instruction of our fun and energetic team. It meets one night per week for 90 minutes, with new sessions beginning every four weeks.

Come back for as many sessions as you’d like, the fun and the knowledge keeps on building. Sign up with friends, or meet new people with similar interests. No prior programming experience is required, but students should be comfortable typing and using a web browser.

## Coding Club Outcomes:
- Create your own computer programs
