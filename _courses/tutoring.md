In addition to teaching [group classes](/register/), our expert instructors are available for 1-on-1 tutoring and small group sessions. Whether you need help finishing that almost-complete Android app, studying for the AP Computer Science exam, or just prefer learning in a more personal environment, weâ€™ve got someone who can get you through it. 

Timing is flexible, our instructors are available throughout the week, including evenings. You can bring your own laptop or borrow one of ours. We work with adults and kids (ages 9+) for these sessions. Tutoring comes in a package of four 1-hour sessions for $200. We recommend spreading these sessions out over a series of weeks, to allow for individual practice time in between sessions, but you can work with our instructors to find the best fit for your schedule.
