In addition to teaching [group classes](/register/), our expert instructors are available for 1-on-1 tutoring and small group sessions. Whether you need help finishing that almost-complete Android app, studying for the AP Computer Science exam, or just prefer learning in a more personal environment, we’ve got someone who can get you through it. 

## Your First 2 Hours

Are you brand new to programming? We offer a special rate for beginners to dive into their **first 2 hours** of programming. You'll sit down with one of our friendly instructors for a gentle introduction to what code is, how we can use it to make websites and apps, and how to write some of your own.

Timing is flexible, our instructors are available throughout the week, mornings and evenings. You can bring your own laptop or borrow one of ours. We work with kids (ages 9+) and adults for these sessions. Just $49 covers your first two hours, after which you can continue at our normal tutoring rate ($95/hr), or we can help you find an upcoming group class or self-study pathway.
