Who says you’re too young to code? We’ve worked with K-12 schools at all levels to let students experience the joys of programming in their early years. If Gates and Zuckerberg can start coding when they were in middle school, so should your students. Bring our team in to facilitate a hands-on Hour of Code session, or to speak to students or faculty about career and entrepreneurial opportunities made possible by software development skills.
