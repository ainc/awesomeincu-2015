Instead of your kids spending their free time playing apps, what if they spent it learning to write them? This camp for middle and high school students will teach the fundamentals of coding. Students will create websites, mobile apps and learn to design video games all while having fun with our energetic team. By the end of the week, each student will have built at least 1 web page, mobile app, and video game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Android, and Unity 3D. We keep this camp small to ensure everyone gets very focused attention and learns at their own pace. Prepare to be amazed!
