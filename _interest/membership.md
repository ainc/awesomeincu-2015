So, you've got the basics down. You've taken a class or two, followed some tutorials, built a few “Hello, world” programs. How do you go beyond learning-to-code and take your software development skills to the next level? The Awesome Inc Membership is our answer.

The Membership is our lightweight training program for adult learners who aspire to improve their software development skills. This program runs for 14 weeks each Spring and Fall, and meets one evening a week for two hours.

During program sessions, our team of coding coaches work with each student to select a challenging final project, assess his or her current skill level, then design a curriculum to help them achieve their goals. Students work alongside other highly-talented peers to gain exposure to a breadth of topics, not just their own focus area. In addition to 28 in-class hours, our coaches are available throughout the semester via Slack online chat.

## Membership Outcomes:

*   Make your own Apps, Games, and Websites
*   Learn Software Development methodology
*   Meet professional programmers from local tech companies
