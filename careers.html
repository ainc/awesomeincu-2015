			<h2 id="bootcamp-lead">Lead Instructor, Web Developer Bootcamp F19</h2>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>We are looking for a Lead Instructor for our <a href="/bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a>. This is a 15-week, full-time assignment. Our Fall 2019 Bootcamp session runs from September 16th - December 6th, 2019. During this 12-week, intensive, in-person program, classes are held Monday - Friday, 8am - 5pm. Within six months of completing our program, &gt;90% of students have launched a new career by landing their first job in software development.</p>
			<h3>Responsibilities</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Lead a cohort of 8-12 adult students, with little to no prior programming experience, to become hireable software developers in 3 months (yes, it's possible, we've done it)</li>
				<li>Work with our Program Director and Assistant Instructor for 3 weeks prior to classes to customize our project-based curriculum into 60 days of lessons that fit your personal style</li>
				<li>Deliver lessons to students, on topics ranging from basic Computer Science to specific framework design patterns, using formats such as lecture, pair programming, and Socratic discussion</li>
				<li>Collaborate with our Assistant Instructor to review student-written code and provide feedback on projects</li>
				<li>Engage other software developers from the region as mentors for your students</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Skills</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Embody Awesome Inc's four Core Values: Be Good, Be Excellent, Be a Friend, Be You</li>
				<li>Thrive in leading a technical team, or in our case, 8-12 aspiring software developers </li>
				<li>Empathy and patience to work with students who aren't technology experts (yet)</li>
				<li>Experience building and maintaining full-stack web applications in production environments</li>
				<li>Experience using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, SQL, Git, Agile, Test-Driven Development, debugging, and deployment with leading PaaS and IaaS cloud hosting</li>
				<li>Experience in using Python, Ruby, or PHP, and Angular, React, or Vue</li>
				<li>GitHub and StackOverflow credibility, or other evidence of an active passion for your craft</li>
				<li>Great communication skills, especially in distilling complex subject matter into simple, memorable explanations</li>
				<li>A good sense of humor – intensive classes don't work if it's all work and no play</li>
				<li>Bonus: lover of ping-pong, Double Stuf Oreos, and the occasional Nerf battle</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Benefits</h3>
			<p>Competitive salary during 15-week assignment.</p>
			<p>Our instructors often treat this teaching role as a sabbatical from their primary development roles. We've found two major benefits to a developer-turned-instructor. First, it provides an opportunity to dive deeply into a particular technology stack. Our Fall 2016 instructor says that after years of building Python and Django applications for satisfied customers, he finally learned the intricacies of this language and framework when he had to teach others to use them. Second, our past instructors tend to form good working relationships with our students, making for particularly strong recruiting connections after the Bootcamp when our instructor returns to his or her primary employer.</p>

			<h2 id="youth-coach">Coding Coach, Youth courses</h2>
			<p>Coding Coaches are the foundation of our instructional team for our youth programs like the <a href="/coding-club/">Coding Club</a>, <a href="/coding-league/">Coding League</a>, <a href="/academy/">Academy</a>, and <a href="/weekofcode/">Week of Code summer camp</a>. An ideal candidate for the Coding Coach, Youth courses role would be an experienced software developer who finds joy in sharing their knowledge with others, or an experienced educator with an passion for building things with technology. The traits of empathy, patience, and clarity of communication are critical in addition to the breadth of technical aptitude that our students require. The ability to explain complex concepts in a simple manner is something you will use every day. With a breadth of new languages, frameworks, and platforms arriving on the scene each year, we're less concerned with the code you've already written than your ability to learn whatever our students need you to learn (and help them learn) next. </p>
			<p>If you like lists, here's something for you:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Teaching / tutoring experience (any level)</li>
				<li>Experience with some combination of: Scratch, iOS, Android, Unity, C#, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Python</li>
				<li>Experience working on teams</li>
				<li>Active GitHub and Stack Overflow profiles are a plus</li>
				<li>Deployed software projects (mobile apps, web apps, video games) a plus</li>
