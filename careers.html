			<h2>Awesome Inc U - Lead Instructor</h2>
			<p>Awesome Inc exists to help entrepreneurs turn their dreams into reality, and increasingly often, those dreams involve software. We started the Awesome Inc U program in 2013 to help more people gain skills and experience in software development. During our first two years, we've had over 500 students for our in-person classes, over 2000 Hour of Code participants, and nearly 10,000 students in our online courses. As we continue to help more people learn to code, we're looking for someone who can help lead our instructional team.</p>
			<p>An ideal candidate for the lead instructor role would be first an educator, and second a programmer. The traits of empathy, patience, and leadership are critical in addition to the breadth of technical aptitude that our students require. The ability to explain complex concepts in a simple manner is just as important for our adult learners as it is for our K-12 learners. With a breadth of new languages, frameworks, and platforms arriving on the scene each year, we're less concerned with the code you've already written than your ability to learn whatever our students need you to learn (and help them learn) next. </p>
			<p>If you like lists, here's something for you:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2+ years of teaching / tutoring experience (any level)</li>
				<li>Experience with some combination of: iOS (Obj-C, Swift), Android, Unity, Java, C#, HTML/CSS, Javascript/jQuery, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Python</li>
				<li>Experience managing teams</li>
				<li>Active GitHub, Stack Overflow, Coach.me profiles are a plus</li>
				<li>Deployed software projects (mobile apps, web apps, video games) a plus</li>
			</ul>
