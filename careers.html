			<p>Awesome Inc exists to help entrepreneurs turn their dreams into reality, and increasingly often, those dreams involve software. We started the Awesome Inc U program in 2013 to help more people gain skills and experience in software development. Since then, we've hosted over {{site.students-taught}} students for in-person classes, and over 10,000 students in our online courses.</p>
			<p>Team members at Awesome Inc are selected for first, their interest in our <a href="https://www.awesomeinc.org/about/#core-values">Core Values</a>, and second for their technical aptitude for their desired role. As a small team, we're also a big fan of people who can "Figure It Out", or FIO.</p>

			<h2 id="bootcamp-lead">Lead Instructor, Web Developer Bootcamp</h2>
			<p>As we launch our first cohort of our 12-week, intensive <a href="/bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a> we're looking for someone who can support our Lead Instructor in delivering instructional content, and our students with applying that content. An ideal candidate for the Teaching Assistant, Web Developer Bootcamp role would be an experienced software developer who finds joy in sharing knowledge, and seeing others learn new concepts. The traits of empathy, patience, and clarity of communication are critical in addition to the breadth of technical aptitude that our students require. The ability to explain complex concepts in a simple manner is something you will use every day. With a breadth of new languages, frameworks, and platforms arriving on the scene each year, we're less concerned with the code you've already written than your ability to learn whatever our students need you to learn (and help them learn) next.</p>
			<p>Here's more of what we look for in a candidate:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>5+ years of web application development experience</li>
				<li>Teaching / tutoring experience (any level)</li>
				<li>Experience with all the following: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, SQL, AngularJS, Git, GitHub, Agile, Amazon Web Services</li>
				<li>Experience with several of the following: iOS (Obj-C, Swift), Android, Java, C# / .NET, Python / Django, PHP / Symfony or Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Node.js</li>
				<li>Active GitHub, Stack Overflow, LinkedIn profiles are a plus</li>
				<li>Deployed software projects (mobile apps, web apps, video games) a plus</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As our Teaching Assistant, Web Developer Bootcamp, you will spend your time hands-on with our students during their 12-week in-person program. Classes for our Fall 2016 cohort run 8am - 5pm, Monday - Friday, August 22nd - November 11th, 2016 at Awesome Inc in downtown Lexington, KY. You will also provide support to students remotely via our Slack team chat. This position is designed to support our Lead Instructor and students during morning lecture time, and to be the primary point of contact for students working on afternoon lab assignments and projects.</p>
			<p>This is a contract position with competitive hourly rates, running for the duration of the Fall 2016 Bootcamp session. It is designed for a full-time (40 hrs/week) role, but can also be broken up into multiple part-time roles (mornings or afternoons, 20 hrs/week).</p>
